### First Task

Find out how many times each borough says the term `knicks`.
Then we can deduce if people actually care about the New York Knicks.

### Results

```ruby
{
  "Manhattan"=>476,
  "Queens"=>323,
  "Brooklyn"=>314,
  "Bronx"=>300,
  "Staten Island"=>96
}
```

### Second Task

Use the boilerplate Rails application to create a webpage that allows you to do the first task.
Generically speaking, build out a webpage that allows one to search neighborhoods for term frequencies.

The boilerplate is [here](neighborhood_counts).
